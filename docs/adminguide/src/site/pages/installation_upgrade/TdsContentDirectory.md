## Purpose

All THREDDS Data Server configuration information is stored under the TDS content directory.
The content directory is created and populated with default files the first time the TDS is deployed or any time the directory is empty.

## Location

The location of this directory is chosen by you, the administrator. 
Due to the importance of this directory, it is a good idea to locate it somewhere separate from `${tomcat_home}` on your file system.
It needs to be persisted between Tomcat upgrades or TDS re-deployments.

The location of the directory is controlled by [setting the `tds.content.root.path` Java system property](jvm_settings.html#tds-content-directory).

{% include warning.html content="
There is no default location for this directory in the TDS; **`tds.content.root.path` must be set or the TDS will not start**. 
"%}

All TDS configuration, modifications, and additions should be made in this directory.
Typically, you will only be adding and modifying catalogs and configuration files.

## `thredds/` Subdirectory

By default, a `thredds/` subdirectory is created in the TDS content directory.
E.g.: `${tds.content.root.path}/thredds/`

The aforementioned configuration files (called [_catalogs_](config_catalog_intro.html)), and other information needed to run the TDS are stored in the `thredds/` subdirectory . 

### Contents

The `thredds/` directory includes a number of files and subdirectories:

~~~bash

## Other Subdirectories In `${tds.content.root.path}`

Supplemental features and programs used by the TDS, such as the [THREDDS Data Manager (TDM)](tdm_ref.html), will create and store relevant  information other subdirectories in `${tds.content.root.path}`.  
E.g.: `${tds.content.root.path}/tdm/`

     
## A Note About Security

Files containing passwords or any other security-related content should **NOT** be placed in the TDS content directory, as this is not the proper location for such files.  

The TDS is designed to serve file system data using the information stored in the TDS content directory.
A misconfiguration on the part of the administrator could result in the inadvertent sharing of this sensitive information.

Please see the [Securing The TDS](securing_tds_overview.html) section of this guide for instructions on how to properly store passwords and sensitive information.
